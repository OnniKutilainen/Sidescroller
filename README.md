Sidescroller

This is my second school project, that I made in collaboration with Mikko Raussi.

HOW TO RUN: To play the game, download the file SidescrollerPlayOnly, open it and run OurEpicSidescroller.exe

HOW TO PLAY: All the menus are controlled with the mouse or WASD and enter. The game itself is controlled with the WAD and attacking is done with the left and right keys. A moves left, D moves right and W jumps. Starting from level 2 you can gain the ability to double jump by collecting the appropriate pickup (In level 2 it's collected automaticly at the beginning of the level). Pressing Esc during gameplay pauses the game and brings up a pop-up menu. Pressing space is adviced against, since in addition to jumping it contains a debugging artefact, that either reloads the current or previous scene.

GOAL: Gather all the golden coins and touch the ending portal (The crystal will turn into a vortex once you've collected all the coins). Avoid falling to your death or being hit by the patrolling drones or projectiles shot by sentry blocks. Touching a bowl of cinders lights it into a bonfire that is used as a checkpoint.

DESCRIPTION: So this is the project we made in our second year of studies at Kymenlaakso university of applied science. I worked together with Mikko Raussi in this project, while Onni Kyt√∂nummi didn't join us due to being preoccupied with other projects. Since our first game was turn based and as simple as possible, we wanted to make something more action-based. So we made a sidescrolling platformer game.

ABOUT LEVELS: As we only had two members, both took part in level design and built them themselves. We then sequenced the levels, so that even numbered level is my and every odd is my partner's, with the exceptions of levels 1 and 9. Level 1 is the base scene we ran during scripting and later extended to a passable level and Level 9 is made by me as an introduction level for the new portal mechanic.
